Task 0 : Store data on S3
##########################################################

1. Create a bucket in S3 and upload the data in the bucket: The data is stored under s3/hiveassignmentsuman/hivesuman
2. Once the cluster is running, open the Hue notebook.: The above bucket is accessible on Hue.

#The Schema of the data set contains Square ID,Time interval,Country code,SMS-In actitvity,SMS-Out activity,Call-In actitvity,Call-Out activity,Internet traffic activity
#In order to treat missing/blank values as NULL , lets include TBLPROPERTIES('serialization.null.format'='');

#You are working as an analyst responsible for analysing telecom data of three countries (country_code = 39, 43, 33). First create a table from the external table created in task 1, to store the data corresponding only to these three countries. Do the following analysis on these three countries.

#Q2. Which country has the minimum total internet activity? Display the country code of this country.

#Q3. Which country among the given three has the second highest total activity? Note that total activity is defined as the sum of sms_in, sms_out, call_in, call_out, internet_traffic. Display the country code of this country. Do not compress the table.

For this task, first compress the table that was created in the beginning of task 2. Submit the result upto three decimal places, without rounding off the digits, obtained after compressing the table.

#a) First create a compression (ORC) table  using the ZLIB compression technique

#b. Populate the table using the external table 'threecountries'

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE cdr_analysis.cdr_orc SELECT * FROM cdr_analysis.threecountries;

#c. Now lets find the total activity for the 3 countries based on the compressed table.Note that total activity is defined as the sum of sms_in, sms_out, call_in, call_out, internet_traffic
